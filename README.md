# ECSTest
ECSTest using Unity 2019.3.6f1 and entity system 0.8.0 as well as Unity 2018.4.17f1 and entity system 0.0.12.

Simple tests of Unity's entity component system with two different versions of Unity. entity system 0.8.0 for unity 2019 is
easier to use in my opinion. It is also easier to find documentation for it.
